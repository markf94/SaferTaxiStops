# SaferTaxiStops
Website submission for the Storytelling Challenge organised by the NGO OpenData Durban.

The following code is usually up & running on www.nowheretostop.co.za but is currently down for maintenance.

NowhereToStop is a data journalism project that sheds a light on the tough life of Durban's minibus taxi drivers.
We used geospatial tools like GIS and Carto to visualize three minibus taxi routes and illustrate how difficult it is for them to stop at legal and safe stops along the road.

This was our submission for the Storytelling Challenge organised by OpenData Durban in November 2016.
