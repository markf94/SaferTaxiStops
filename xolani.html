								"I usually work seven days a week, starting from 5am to 7pm."
							</blockquote>
					</aside>

						<p class="driverarticle">
				Xolani Sithole* is always the first one awake in his Umlazi home by 4am, leaving his wife and children fast asleep as he makes the journey across town to collect his taxi and start the day’s work. His route runs from the leafy Durban suburb of Morningside to the bustling CBD market and back, and occasionally, he’s called on to hit the long distance route to Stanger.
				<br><br>
Sithole works extremely hard to get his customers to work on time, continuously trying to keep them safe and happy as he dodges police fines, traffic lights and motorists’ insults. It’s all in a day’s work for him and hundreds of taxi drivers across the city.
<br><br>
“I usually work seven days a week, starting from 5am to 7pm,” he says. “I do eleven round trips on a busy day and maybe eight on a quiet day.” His busiest days, he explains, are Monday, Friday and Saturday, and the last day of the month is always frenetic.
<br><br>
“The owner expects me to cash R1,000 every day since I’m driving a 22-seater, but if I don’t make R1,000 he doesn’t shout at me because he understands not all days are the same.”
<br><br>
Sithole says that if you cash R600 the owner will ask you what “transpired” and as a driver, you have to explain why. “I do feel under pressure to do as many trips as possible every day, especially since we have seven 22-seaters working the same route for the owner,” he says.
<br><br>
But it’s risky on the route and much like several other taxi drivers who stop in the vicinity of Warwick Junction, he is concerned about dodging traffic fines, and of course, the safety of his passengers.
<br><br></p>
<aside class="pquoteright">
    <blockquote>
			"Some [passengers] say that they have been jumping off in the same place for over 20 years, but if the police see me [doing this] they give me a fine."
		</blockquote>
</aside>
<p class="driverarticle">
“There are not enough safe places to drop off and pick up passengers on my route in Durban and surrounding areas,” he insists. “This is because there are no places assigned for taxi stops.”
<br><br>
So, Sithole stops illegally, sometimes unsafely, near traffic lights, at bus stops, close to fire hydrants and sometimes to the frustration of motorists, in the middle of a busy traffic lane at rush hour, all to drop off and pick up passengers.
<br><br>
He says that motorists view taxi drivers as “skhotheni”. “They have no respect for us, they call us names and shout at us for stopping in no-stopping areas.”
<br><br>
But he feels he has no choice but to stop at these unsafe places because passengers shout at him if he doesn’t. “Some say that they have been jumping off in the same place for over 20 years, but if the police see me [doing this] they give me a fine.”
<br><br>
Sithole and other drivers have to fork out of their own pockets to pay these fines without any help from their taxi owner bosses. But on a weekly wage of just R1,000 it’s impossible to keep up with the fines that are pouring in.
<br><br>
“I cannot afford to pay all my fines, recently I was stopped and found to have a warrant for my arrest for a R600 fine. I was released after I had paid that R600. I also have a R300 summons,” he says.
<br><br>
Sithole says that since the government knows the taxi industry is a busy one they should create taxi stops just like the bus stops situated all over cities and towns throughout the country. He likes the idea of formal taxi stops but is worried his customers might not be so keen on such a major change.
<br><br>
</p>
<aside class="pquotecenter">
    <blockquote class="center">
			"If there was one thing I could change about my life – that would be waking up early, leaving my family asleep and coming back when my children are asleep."
		</blockquote>
</aside>
<p class="driverarticle">

“Having a map displayed inside my taxi showing commuters safe stops may work, but I tell you, commuters will not accept it,” he says.
<br><br>
By the time Sithole has navigated his route for the eleventh time for the day and safely dropped off his last customer the sun has slipped away and he makes his way home.
<br><br>
“If there was one thing I could change about my life – that would be waking up early, leaving my family asleep and coming back when my children are asleep. My hopes and dreams for the future is to get a job that won’t make me leave my house as early as 4am and come back late so I can get enough time to spend with my family.”

														This is what one of Sithole's passengers thinks of the issue of safer taxi stops:
														</p>
													<aside class="pquoteright">
															<blockquote >
															"I think it’s right that people ask to be dropped off anywhere because it’s where they are supposed to jump off.""
															</blockquote>
													</aside>
													<p class="driverarticle">
															Durban domestic worker Dudu Nzama forks out half of her daily wages on taxi fare to get from her home in Dasenhoek to work in Morningside. “I use a taxi every day from home to work and back because taxis are quicker than buses. Sometimes I take a bus from work if it comes first. Taxi drivers drive well, but they are not all the same,” she said.
<br /><br />
	Nzama spends half of her salary on taxi fare but she says it’s the best form of transport as there is no train station near her home. “I spend R48 every day on taxis because I take two taxis from home to work and two back home every day,” Nzama said. Taxi fare from Dasenhoek to the market taxi rank in the CBD costs R17 and she forks out a further R7 to get to her employer’s home in Morningside, a total of R576 in a four-week month. Nzama starts work at 7.30am and goes home as soon as all of her work for the day has been completed. “I am able to live from the money I earn and to save for transport which is half of my salary. I support my three kids and my husband also supports us as he’s working,” she said.
<br /><br />
	Nzama said she appreciates the fact that taxi drivers drop passengers anywhere along the route. She explained that a driver has never refused to drop her off or pick her up somewhere because of unsafe road conditions. “ I think it’s right that people ask to be dropped off anywhere because it’s where they are supposed to jump off.” Nzama was not impressed with the suggestion of setting up designated safe taxi stops where drivers can drop passengers. She said that she wouldn’t be happy if a driver refused to drop her exactly she wanted. “But it would depend on the distance between where I wanted to be dropped off and where the driver thinks it’s safe to me off.”
<br /><br />
</p>
<aside class="pquoteleft">
	<blockquote >
"Nzama was not impressed with the suggestion of setting up designated safe taxi stops where drivers can drop passengers."
	</blockquote>
</aside>
<p class="driverarticle">
	She added that commuters were inconvenienced by the taxi strikes which sometimes arise when eThekwini Metro Police impound taxis because of the many unpaid traffic fines slapped on drivers for speeding and stopping illegally at bus stops and other no-stopping zones.  “Taxi strikes affect us as commuters because we come to work using taxis and when it’s time to go home taxis are not working, making it very hard for us to get back home,” Nzama said. During the last taxi strike, she took a bus going downtown and struggled to get a taxi back home. In the end, she called a relative to pick her up and drive her home.
<br /><br />
	Several taxi drivers across the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were afraid of retribution from taxi bosses and passengers said it was a problem that there were no designated taxi stops anywhere in the city and surrounding suburbs. “I sometimes pretend that I can’t hear the passengers when they ask me to drop them in unsafe places like on the freeway here coming into town because I know it’s not safe for them to jump off,” said one driver. Taxi drivers said they would appreciate signs in their taxis to educate commuters about the need to stop in safe zones but they were doubtful and afraid that their customers would not take “no” for an answer.
